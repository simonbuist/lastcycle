After the eruption of [[Mount Verev]], the land began to be plagued with wet, muddy storms of ash. No clean rain falls, and the precipitation that does occur mixes with volcanic ash in the air as it falls, becoming acidic and undrinkable.

Ashstorms are wild, dangerous thunderstorms that smother crops, pollute wells and ponds, and kill those exposed to them for extended periods of time. Shelters must be built strong to last an ashstorm for any extended period of time.

Nearer the city of [[Terret]], the storms are weaker, still unpleasant but less lethal. Exposed iron and other oxidizing metals are architectural status symbols within [[Terret]], do to the significant manual labour required to polish away rust caused by the ashstorms.
