The High God Eindei, creator of life and protector of [[Terret]], is the deity worshipped by [[The Church of the Cycle]]. Eindei takes the form of a snake curled in upon itself, displaying their protection of the cycles of the world. Eindei's sibling and enemy is [[Verev]], the god of destruction, with whom they exist eternally in a repeating series of battles to ward off the complete destruction of the world.

[[The Church of the Cycle|The Church]] teaches that history is and always has taken a cyclical pattern beginning with Eindei creating and establishing minor gods and life in their world. They protect it for thousands of years from [[Verev]] through battle, before finally defeating [[Verev]] and casting them back into their volcano. This final battle is always immensely destructive to the world, causing the deaths of the minor gods and the near-destruction of the world. After this battle, Eindei hibernates to regain their might before reintroducing life to the world. They currently rest in the [[Great Spring]], and by their mercy keep the city of [[Terret]] alive with the gift of [[The Three Rivers]].
