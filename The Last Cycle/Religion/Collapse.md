The Collapse refers to a series of events 3 centuries ago, that lead to the current state of Terret and its surroundings. The collapse began with the eruption of [[Mount Verev]], leading to a decade-long volcanic winter, the death of most flora, the origin of the [[Ashstorms]], and the end of the [[Kingdom of Taarden]]. Following the volcanic winter, Terret and its surrounding lands have experienced only drought aside from the [[Ashstorms]].

[[The Church of the Cycle]] professes the truth that the Collapse marked the end of the previous Cycle of the World, with the eruption of [[Mount Verev]] marking the death of [[Verev]] and the beginning of [[Eindei|Eindei's]] hibernation. The holy duty of all citizens of Terret is to wait and pray for the awakening of [[Eindei]] and the beginning of the next Cycle.

Certain heretics claim that the Collapse was a simple natural event, and not the will of [[Eindei]] and his children. They also claim that the world must change and adapt to the new ecological reality. Worst of these are the [[Gardeners]], a fiendish order of druids and magicians attempting to subvert the will of [[Eindei]] and create arcane abominations of nature, adapted to drought and [[Ashstorms]]. [[Terret]] must be cleansed of these sinners, and [[Eindei]] will continue in his rest until these heretical ideologies have been cleaned from the world.
