Formally the rulers of [[Terret]], the Patriciate are the nobility of the city. The Patriciate is led by [[Prince Willem]] of the [[House of Blauw-Terret]]. There are a few dozen lesser noble Houses, each headed by a Count or Countess. The lesser Houses maintain their power and wealth through the exploitation of the judicial system, with judges appointed by the [[Prince Willem|Prince]] sentencing individuals to serfdom on their estates outside the city. These agricultural estates are the primary source of food within the city, ensuring the power of the Patriciate so long as their hold over the land is maintained.

The lesser houses fortify their relative power to each other mainly through gaining judicial seats as favours from the [[Prince Willem|Prince]]. More judges within a house provides more forced labour from citizens sentenced for crimes. The courts of the Patriciate are beyond corrupt, and being accused of a crime by the [[Civic Guard]] all but guarantees a conviction.
