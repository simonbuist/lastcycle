The Banker's Guild regulates and licenses lending and borrowing within [[Terret]]. It is likely the most influential of the Guilds in the [[Regentsbond]], and is part of the Raad. Credit is, for the most part, only afforded to Guild members, nobles of the [[Patriciate]], and [[Landlords]]. When loans are provided to the [[Proletariat]], they are with absurdly high interest or collateral and criminal prosecution is pursued through the [[Patriciate]] courts for any lapse in payment.
