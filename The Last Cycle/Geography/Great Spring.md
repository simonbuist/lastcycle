The Great Spring, Alaeala, is the last major source of water in the world. It never has and never will run dry.  The High God [[Eindei]] sleeps at its center, waiting to renew the world. [[The Three Rivers|Three rivers]] flow from Alaeala, maintaining the life of [[Terret]] and its surroundings. The Great Spring also feeds the [[Canals|canals]] used for transportation within [[Terret]].
Surrounding the Great Spring are three districts: the [[Regentsbond|Guild's]] [[Oudemarkt]], the [[Patriciate|Patriciate's]] [[Prinsvike]], and the [[The Church of the Cycle|Church's]] [[Great Cathedral]].
