Built around the [[Great Spring]], Terret is the last city in the world.

Terret is home to well over a million residents, ruled by [[Prince Willem]] and the [[Patriciate]], upheld by the [[The Contract]] with [[The Church of the Cycle]] and the [[Regentsbond]]. Order in the city is mostly maintained by the [[Civic Guard]] and the courts of the [[Patriciate]].
