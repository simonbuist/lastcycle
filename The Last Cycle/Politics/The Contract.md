The Contract is the agreement balancing power within [[Terret]] between the [[Patriciate]], the [[The Church of the Cycle|Church]], and the [[Regentsbond]], formed in the aftermath of the [[Collapse]]. Through the Contract, a relatively stable peace is held between the competing interests of its parties.

Within the Contract, formal executive power is granted to [[Prince Willem]], while legislative, judicial, and limited taxation powers are granted to the [[Patriciate]] so long as they don't impede on the rights of the [[Regentsbond]] and the [[The Church of the Cycle|Church]] to govern trade and religion respectively.

The stability of the Contract comes from the competing interests of the [[The Church of the Cycle|Church]] and the [[Regentsbond]], both not considering themselves powerful enough to overthrow the combined force of their counterpart allied with the [[Patriciate]].

All three parties maintain their own military forces, although the [[Knight Orders]] of the [[Patriciate]] are significantly smaller than the [[Civic Guard]] of the [[Regentsbond]] and the [[The Inquisition|Inquisitors]] of the [[The Church of the Cycle|Church]].
