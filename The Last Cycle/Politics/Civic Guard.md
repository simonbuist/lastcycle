The Civic Guard is the police force of [[Terret]], serving under the [[Regentsbond]]. The Civic Guard is a deeply corrupt institution, easily bribed, and serving only to uphold the power of the [[Regentsbond]]. In writing, the Civic Guard enforces the laws of [[Prince Willem]] and the [[Patriciate]], but in practice only maintain the social order, extort non-Guild citizens, and prosecute particularly egregious crimes.
