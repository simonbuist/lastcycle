Some inhabitants of [[The Wilds]] make their living not by honest means but through theft and pillaging. Many different gangs of bandits are out there, some open to negotiation and some who kill before they talk.

Rumours exist of a [[Bandit King]] whom bandits of [[The Wilds]] have sworn fealty to.

Bandits  more frequently run into near [[The Three Rivers]] due to the higher density of [[Wild Towns]].
