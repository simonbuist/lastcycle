The small villages found in [[The Wilds]], outside the authority of [[The Contract]], are referred to as Wild Towns. Wild Towns are invariably built around a source of drinkable water, but beyond that vary wildly in terms of size, governmental structure (or lack thereof), and economy.

Folks who live in Wild Towns find themselves coming into constant conflict with [[Bandits]], and have different levels of cooperation or animosity towards [[Gardeners]]. Closer to [[Terret]], Wild Towns may have a stronger connection with [[The Church of the Cycle]], potentially relying on its [[The Inquisition|Inquisitors]] for protection from [[Bandits]].
